											THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE").
											THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW.
											ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.</p>
										<p align="justify">
											BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE.
											TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT,
											THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
										</p>
										<p>
											1. Definitions
											<blockquote>
										    1. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a
										    translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or
										    phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
										    transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a
										    Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work
										    is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching")
										    will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.<br><br>

										    2. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances,
										    phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of
										    the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its
										    entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in
										    themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered
										    an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License.<br><br>

										    3. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate,
										    through sale or other transfer of ownership.<br><br>

										    4. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.<br><br>

										    5. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who
										    created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance
										    the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform
										    literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal
										    entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that
										    transmits the broadcast.<br><br>

										    6. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License including without limitation any
										    production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital
										    form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or
										    dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a
										    cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing,
										    painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by
										    a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative
										    to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent
										    it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise
										    considered a literary or artistic work.<br><br>

										    7. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this
										    License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License
										    despite a previous violation.<br><br>

										    8. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations,
										    by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make available to the public
										    Works in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them;
										    to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the Work,
										    including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.<br><br>

										    9. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the
										    right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital
										    form or other electronic medium.</blockquote>
										</p>
										<p>
											2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or
											rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection under
											copyright law or other applicable laws.
										</p>
										<p>
											3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide,
											royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights
											in the Work as stated below:
											<blockquote>
										    1. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated
										    in the Collections;<br><br>

										    2. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium,
										    takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work.
										    For example, a translation could be marked "The original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification
										    could indicate "The original work has been modified.";<br><br>

										    3. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,<br><br>

										    4. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.<br><br>

										    5. For the avoidance of doubt:
										    <blockquote>
											1. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any
											statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such
											royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;<br><br>

											2. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any
											statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties
											for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and,<br><br>

											3. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event
											that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society,
											from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.</blockquote>
										    The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights
										    include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and
										    formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.</blockquote>
										</p>
										<p>
											4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
										    <blockquote>
										    1. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the
										    Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not
										    offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to
										    exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep
										    intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or
										    Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on
										    the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the
										    terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the
										    Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice
										    from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as
										    requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
										    Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.<br><br>

										    2. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made
										    pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means
										    You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original
										    Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for
										    attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name
										    of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any,
										    that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
										    information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use
										    of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work
										    by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that
										    in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the
										    Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other
										    contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of
										    attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly
										    assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as
										    appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author,
										    Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.<br><br>

										    3. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce,
										    Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort,
										    mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's
										    honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in
										    Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or
										    other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as
										    appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise
										    Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.</blockquote>
										</p>
										<p>
											5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer<br>
											UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS
											OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
											WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER
											DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
											EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
										</p>
										<p>
											6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU
											ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE
											OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
										</p>
										<p>
											7. Termination
											<blockquote>
										    1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
										    Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their
										    licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7,
										    and 8 will survive any termination of this License.<br><br>

										    2. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright
										    in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop
										    distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
										    license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full
										    force and effect unless terminated as stated above.</blockquote>
										</p>
										<p>
											8. Miscellaneous
											<blockquote>
										    1. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the
										    Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.<br><br>

										    2. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work
										    on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.<br><br>

										    3. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or
										    enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement,
										    such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.<br><br>

										    4. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall
										    be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.<br><br>

										    5. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no
										    understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by
										    any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual
										    written agreement of the Licensor and You.<br><br>

										    6. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the
										    Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of
										    1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright
										    Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which
										    the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty
										    provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes
										    additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License
										    is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.</blockquote>

										</p>
										<p>
											5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
											by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

											result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,

											has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
										</p>
										<p>
											9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
											and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
											License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
											of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
											incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
